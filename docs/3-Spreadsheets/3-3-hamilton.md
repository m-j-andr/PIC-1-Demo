*The Federalist Papers* are a collection of essays written by
Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison
under the pseudonym *Publius*.
They were published from 1787 to 1788.

The essays were intended to persuade New Yorkers
at the time to ratify the new U.S. Constitution.
Over time, these essays became highly influential in
the interpretation of United States constitutional theory.




## Essays 49 to 57, 62, and 63

As you look through `01.txt` to `85.txt`,
you will notice that most essays are
attributed to Hamilton, Jay, or Madison;
some are attributed to Madison with Hamilton.
However, if you look at `49.txt` to `57.txt`,
`62.txt` and `63.txt`, the author is listed as
Madison **or** Hamilton.

> "... The original manuscripts have never been found and were most likely destroyed at the time of printing (except for the drafts of Jay's essays)... The number [Madison] claimed [to have written] in a list first made public in 1818... differed significantly from one attributed to Hamilton, which had appeared ten years earlier in *The Port Folio*, a Philadelphia magazine. The 14 November 1807 issue of that magazine reproduced a memorandum, said to be in Hamilton's handwriting... The discrepancy between these two lists gave rise to a famous literary dispute over the authorship of certain numbers of *The Federalist*...
