# Weighted Averages and a Trip to the Museum 


A museum has the following exhibitions.
 - Ancient Greek Artefacts
 - Middle Eastern Mosaics
 - South American Sculptures
 - Polynesian Paintings

The items in the Ancient Greek Artefacts exhibition
account for 17% of the museum's items.
The following table records similar
*statistics* for all of the exhibitions.

|                Exhibition | Fraction of museum |
| ------------------------: | :----------------: |
|   Ancient Greek Artefacts |         17%        |
|    Middle Eastern Mosaics |         26%        |
| South American Sculptures |         19%        |
|      Polynesian Paintings |         38%        |

You visit this museum and you look around the exhibitions,
but you only manage to see a *fraction* of each.
The following table details your visit.

|                Exhibition | Fraction of exhibition visited |
| ------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
|   Ancient Greek Artefacts |               62%              |
|    Middle Eastern Mosaics |               85%              |
| South American Sculptures |               55%              |
|      Polynesian Paintings |               22%              |

What fraction of the museum have you seen overall?
It might be tempting to calculate
<div>
  \[\frac{62\ +\ 85\ +\ 55\ +\ 22}{4}\ =\ 56\]
</div>
and claim that you visited 56% of the museum.
**This is incorrect.**
