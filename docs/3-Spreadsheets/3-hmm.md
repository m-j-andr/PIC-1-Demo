# Hamilton or Not Hamilton Analysis


## Analysis 1

 - *What does the pivot table suggest to you about
   the true authors of the "MADISON or HAMILTON" essays?*

   The table shows that "upon" appears
   374 times in the essays credited to HAMILTON
   and 7 times in the essays credited to MADISON.
   This means HAMILTON uses "upon" over 50 times
   more than MADISON in the essays attributed to
   them individually.

   "Upon" is only used three times in
   the "MADISON or HAMILTON" essays.
   This usage appears to be more consistent
   with MADISON having written the essays...

 - *Imagine that a person who you mistrust has shown this pivot table to you,
   and so you are wary of being manipulated by the data that they have presented.
   Can you think of other explanations for the data presented which are currently plausible
   (because the pivot table does not display all the information)?*

   However, the pivot table does not display enough information.
   Based only on the pivot table, one could speculate that
   HAMILTON wrote 50 times more essays than MADISON
   (or that HAMILTON wrote 5 times as many essays
   and that they were around 10 times longer)
   and that there were noticeably fewer
   "MADISON or HAMILTON" essays than
   individual MADISON or HAMILTON essays.


## Analysis 2

 - *What does the pivot table suggest to you about
   the true authors of the "MADISON or HAMILTON" essays?*

   The table shows that every essay credited to HAMILTON
   individually uses at least two "upon"s and that there are
   13 essays credited to MADISON individually which use
   "upon" one time or not at all.
    - There are 9 "MADISON or HAMILTON" essays which do not
      use the word "upon", and it is reasonable to conjecture
      that MADISON was the true author of these essays.
    - Based on the "upon" usage, it also seems most likely
      that MADISON wrote the "MADISON or HAMILTON" essay
      that uses "upon" a single time.
    - There is one "MADISON or HAMILTON" essay that uses
      "upon" twice. Since there are five HAMILTON essays
      that use "upon" twice and only one MADISON essay
      that uses "upon" twice, one could reasonably claim
      that HAMILTON authored this essay
      (since $\frac{5}{1} > \frac{51}{15}$).

 - *Is the authorship question more nuanced than
   you thought during analysis 1? Why?*

   Yes, the authorship question is more nuanced
   than it appeared in *analysis 1* because the
   pivot table has revealed at least one essay
   where the use of "upon" actually suggests
   that HAMILTON authored the essay.


## Analysis 3

 - *What does the pivot table suggest to you about
   the true authors of the "MADISON or HAMILTON" essays?*

   The table shows that
   only one essay credited to HAMILTON individually
   uses between 0 and 2 "upon"s per 10,000 characters,
   whereas 14 essays credited to MADISON individually
   use between 0 and 2 "upon"s per 10,000 characters.

   All of the "MADISON or HAMILTON" essays use
   between 0 and 2 "upon"s per 10,000 characters.
   Again, it seems most likely that MADISON
   authored the "MADISON or HAMILTON" essays.

 - *Imagine that you are a descendent of Hamilton and you wish to argue on his behalf.
   What data in the pivot table that you just created should you point at vigorously?*

   The essay credited to HAMILTON individually that
   uses between 0 and 2 "upon"s per 10,000 characters
   shows that there is a possibility that HAMILTON
   authored some of the "MADISON or HAMILTON" essays.
   It seems that not all of his essays required such
   frequent use of the word "upon"!


## Analysis 4

 - *What does the pivot table suggest to you about
   the true authors of the "MADISON or HAMILTON" essays?*

   The table shows that
   no essays credited to HAMILTON individually
   use between 0 and 1.6 "upon"s per 10,000 characters,
   whereas 14 essays credited to MADISON individually
   use between 0 and 1.6 "upon"s per 10,000 characters.

   10 of the "MADISON or HAMILTON" essays use
   between 0 and 1.6 "upon"s per 10,000 characters.
   It seems most likely that MADISON authored these essays.
   One "MADISON or HAMILTON" essay uses
   more "upon"s per 10,000 characters,
   and this essay certainly requires
   further investigation.

 - *Based on analysis 3 and analysis 4,
   are there some essays that you would like
   to pay special attention to?*

   - Analysis 3 highlighted an essay credited to HAMILTON individually
     that uses between 0 and 2 "upon"s per 10,000 characters.
   - Analysis 3 also showed an essay credited to MADISON individually
     that uses between 2 and 4 "upon"s per 10,000 characters.
   - Analysis 4 highlighted a "MADISON or HAMILTON" essay
     that uses between 1.6 and 3.2 "upon"s per 10,000 characters.

   These essays are interesting as examples of
   HAMILTON using "upon" less frequently than normal,
   MADISON using "upon" more frequently than normal,
   and a "MADISON or HAMILTON" essay for which it is
   particularly difficult to conjecture authorship.


## Analysis 5

 - *What does the pivot table suggest to you about
   the true authors of the **shortest** "MADISON or HAMILTON" essays?*

   When looking at the essays that use fewer than 11,200 characters,
   we find 16 essays credited to HAMILTON individually,
   no essays credited to MADISON individually,
   and four "MADISON or HAMILTON" essays.
   This analysis could lead one to speculate
   that HAMILTON authored the four shortest
   "MADISON or HAMILTON" essays.

 - *Do you feel manipulated by analysis 1 to 4?*

   This part was written to manipulate you
   to feel manipulated by *analysis 1 to 4*!!

   > ["This is getting manipulated, man!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBkoK3VCSyQ){:target="_blank"} Sir Lewis Hamilton.

   It is very easy,
   and it might even be required by a publisher,
   for the same author to write many articles
   of substantially different lengths.
   It is much less likely that
   an author will deviate from
   their usual use of words like
   "upon", "while", "enough", and "intended".
   This length analysis has been useful for
   highlighting that focusing on a single word
   may be too simplistic to reach solid conclusions
   and that data can tell many different stories.
   However, this analysis, by itself, is probably
   less valuable than *analysis 1 to 4*.


## Conditional Formatting Analysis

 - *What do you notice about the green boxes?*

   Every green box corresponds to an essay credited to HAMILTON individually.

 - *What do you notice about the blue boxes?*

   There are blue boxes corresponding to essays written by MADISON with HAMILTON and
   there are blue boxes corresponding to "MADISON or HAMILTON" essays. However,
   there is not a single blue box corresponding to an essay credited to HAMILTON individually.

 - *There are three yellow boxes.
   In the table, each yellow box corresponds to a different author.
   Therefore, the significance of each feels quite different.
   For each of the yellow boxes,
   describe the significance of the box being yellow.*

   These yellow boxes highlight
   HAMILTON using "upon" less frequently than normal,
   MADISON using "upon" more frequently than normal,
   and essay 54, a "MADISON or HAMILTON" essay for which
   it is particularly difficult to conjecture authorship.

 - *There are four orange boxes.
   Who do you think is the true author of essay 50?*

   Only four essays are shorter than 8,000 characters.
   Three of them are concretely credited to HAMILTON individually.
   One of them, essay 50, is a "MADISON or HAMILTON" essay.
   We remarked above that this length analysis, by itself,
   may not be particularly valuable, but essay 50 also
   happens to be one of only two "MADISON or HAMILTON"
   essays that use the word "upon".
   I am confused by essay 50!


## Conjecturing the Authorship of Essays 49 to 57, 62, and 63

 - *Which option do you pick?*

   I choose the third option and
   I pick essays 49, 51, 52, 53, 55, 56, 57, 62, and 63;
   not essays 50 and 54.

 - *How do you specify the true author for the papers that you chose?*

   For essays 49, 51, 52, 53, 55, 56, 57, 62, and 63,
   I conjecture that MADISON is the true author.

 - *Justify your decisions.*
   - For the 9 essays that I selected, I choose MADISON based on *analysis 2*.
   - The use of "upon" in essays 50 and 54 casts doubt on their authorship:
     enough "upon"s to consider HAMILTON as the author,
     but not enough "upon"s to rule out MADISON.
