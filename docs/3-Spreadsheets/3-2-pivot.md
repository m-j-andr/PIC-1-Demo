# Google Sheets - Pivot Tables




## Creating a Pivot Table and Selecting a Suggested Option

 - **Make sure to exit any filter views you used to answer the previous questions.**
   - Click on the calculator to the right of where it says `Tutoring`
     (where it used to say `Table1`).
   - Click `Exit view`.
 - Click anywhere on the table.
 - Select `Insert > Pivot table` from the top menu.
   ![Creating a pivot table](./sheets-screenshots/16.png)
   - "Data range: Tutoring" is perfect.
   - "Insert to: New sheet"  is perfect.
   - Click `Create`.
 - Select the suggested "Sum of Time (Minutes) for each Name by Course".
   ![Creating a suggested pivot table](./sheets-screenshots/17.png)
 - Select all columns by
   clicking to the left of the column heading `A` and above the row label `1`.
   While all columns are selected...
    - Select `Format > Alignment > Center`.
    - If you like, also double-click on the boundary between the column headings `B` and `C`.
      This will make the columns shrink or expand to fit their current contents,
      although you may have to do this again in the future.

## Essential Functionality

 - Scrolling between different sheets.
   - At the bottom, click `tutoring.csv` to go back to the original table.
   - At the bottom, click `Pivot Table 1` to go to the table that you just created.
   - The little arrow next to these names allows you to rename them, if you want.

 - Freezing rows.
   - When scrolling down through the pivot table,
     the column headings go out of view.
   - Select `View > Freeze > 2 rows` from the top menu.
   - When scrolling down through the pivot table,
     the column headings now stay in view.

 - Hiding and displaying the pivot table editor.
   - Where you selected "Sum of Time (Minutes) for each Name by Course"
     is called the *pivot table editor*.
   - You can click the cross to the top-right to close it.
     ![Closing the pivot table editor](./sheets-screenshots/19.png)
   - A little green pencil is often displayed to the bottom-left of the table.
     Hovering near it will cause the word "Edit" to appear.
     Clicking on it will display the pivot table editor again.
     ![Opening the pivot table editor](./sheets-screenshots/20.png)




## Different ways to process the values

 - Scrolling to the bottom of the pivot table editor,
   there is a heading saying **Values**.
   Try the following options.
   - SUM
   - COUNT
     ![Selecting count with the pivot table editor](./sheets-screenshots/21.png)
   - MAX
   - MIN
   - AVERAGE
 - Go back to SUM.




## Using Filters

 - Scrolling to the bottom of the pivot table editor,
   there is a heading saying **Filters**.
 - Click `Add`.
 - Click `Name`.
   ![Adding a filter](./sheets-screenshots/22.png)
 - Click the box that currently says "Showing all items".
 - Click `Clear`.
 - Type `Mitchel` in the search box.
 - Click on the `Mitchel Anders` search result.
   ![Adding a filter](./sheets-screenshots/23.png)
 - Click `OK`.
 - Scroll up to see the data for Mitchel Anders.

The behavior of the filter is a little buggy.
Suppose we want to see the data for
Mitchel Anders and Benson Lynn.
You would hope to...
 - Click the box that currently says "Showing 1 item".
 - Type `Benson` in the search box.
 - Click on the `Benson Lynn` search result.
 - Click `OK`.

However, sometimes
`Benson Lynn` is not displayed after
typing `Benson` in the search box.
![Filter bug](./sheets-screenshots/24.png)
If this occurs for you...

 - Click `OK` anyway.
 - Then click "Showing 1 item" again.
   Now `Benson Lynn` is displayed. 
 - Click on the `Benson Lynn` search result.
 - Click `OK`.
 - You can now see the data for Mitchel Anders and Benson Lynn.
   ![Filter results](./sheets-screenshots/25.png)

Remove the filter by clicking the
cross just below where it says "Add".
Now, let's filter by date.
 - Scroll to the bottom of the pivot table editor,
   where the heading says **Filters**.
 - Click `Add`.
 - Click `Timestamp`.
 - Click the box that currently says "Showing all items".
 - Click `Filter by condition`.
 - Click where it says `None` and select `Date is`.
 - Click where it says `today` and select `exact date`.
 - Type `09/08/2025` into the "Value or formula" box.
   ![Adding a filter for the date](./sheets-screenshots/26.png)
 - Click `OK`.
   ![Filter results](./sheets-screenshots/27.png)




## Sorting and Toggling Totals

 - Under both the **Rows** and **Columns** heading,
   one can toggle "Show totals".
   - Turning on "Show totals" for rows creates a new row
     which stores the sums of the values in each column.
   - Turning on "Show totals" for columns creates a new column
     which stores the sums of the values in each row.

 - Under both the **Rows** and **Columns** heading,
   one can specify "Order" and "Sort by".
   - The rows are currently arranged so that
     the names are in alphabetical order.
   - Under the **Rows** heading,
     change "Sort by" to "SUM of Time (Minutes) in Grand Total".
     Click on the image below to see what to expect.
     <img id="sorting" src="./sheets-screenshots/28.png" alt="Sorting"/>
     <script>
       const sorting = document.getElementById('sorting');
       let sorting_clicked_on_an_even_number_of_times = true;
       sorting.addEventListener('click', function() {
         sorting_clicked_on_an_even_number_of_times = !sorting_clicked_on_an_even_number_of_times;
         sorting.src = sorting_clicked_on_an_even_number_of_times ? './sheets-screenshots/28.png' : './sheets-screenshots/29.png';
       });
     </script>

   - Now the student who spent the most time at tutoring sessions
     on 09/08/2025 --- Mariana da Silva --- is at the bottom.
     ![Sorting](./sheets-screenshots/30.png)
   - Under the **Rows** heading,
     change "Order" to "Descending".
   - Now Mariana da Silva is at the top.
   - The columns are currently arranged so that
     the class names are in alphabetical order.
   - Under the **Columns** heading,
     change "Sort by" to "SUM of Time (Minutes) in Grand Total".
   - You can see Econ 1 to the right because
     it was the most popular for tutoring that day.
     ![Sorting](./sheets-screenshots/31.png)




## Some Questions About The Data

Use Pivot Tables to **elegantly** answer the following questions
with **minimal scrolling through data**.

 - How many times did Isabel Nguyen attend tutoring?
 - Which course did they receive the most tutoring sessions for?
 - How many times did Fatima Al-Farsi attend tutoring?
 - Which course did they dedicate the least time to during their tutoring sessions?
 - Which Elena spent the most time at tutoring sessions?
 - What was the total time this Elena attended tutoring for?
 - Which course did the Elenas dedicate the most time to during their tutoring sessions?
 - What was the total tutoring time the Elenas dedicated to this course?
 - What was the total time that all Elenas attended tutoring for?




## Pivot Tables - What They Are For?

The previous questions can be answered elegantly using pivot tables.

 - How many times did Isabel Nguyen attend tutoring?
   - Under the **Values** heading,
     change "Summarize by" to COUNT.
   - Under the **Filters** heading,
     add a filter which selects only Isabel Nguyen.
   - Under the **Columns** heading,
     make sure "Show totals" is selected.
   - We can see the answer: *20*.

 - Which course did they receive the most tutoring sessions for?
   - Under the **Columns** heading,
     change "Sort by" to "COUNT of Time (Minutes) in Grand Total".
   - We can see the answer: *Math 31A*.
     ![Isabel Nguyen](./sheets-screenshots/32.png)

 - How many times did Fatima Al-Farsi attend tutoring?
   - Remove the filter for Isabel Nguyen.
   - Add a filter which selects only Fatima Al-Farsi.
   - We can see the answer: *20* (the same as Isabel Nguyen).
     ![Fatima Al-Farsi](./sheets-screenshots/33.png)

 - Which course did they dedicate the least time to during their tutoring sessions?
   - Under the **Values** heading,
     change "Summarize by" to SUM.
   - Under the **Columns** heading,
     "Sort by" has conveniently changed to "SUM of Time (Minutes) in Grand Total".
   - We can see the answer: *Engr 110*.
     ![Fatima Al-Farsi](./sheets-screenshots/34.png)

 - Which Elena spent the most time at tutoring sessions?
   - Remove the filter for Fatima Al-Farsi.
   - Add a filter which selects the Elenas.
   - Under the **Rows** heading,
     change "Sort by" to "SUM of Time (Minutes) in Grand Total".
   - We can see the answer: *Elena Ivanova*.

 - What was the total time this Elena attended tutoring for?
   - We can see the answer: *685*.

 - Which course did the Elenas dedicate the most time to during their tutoring sessions?
   - Under the **Rows** heading,
     make sure "Show totals" is selected.
   - We can see the answer: *Physics 7*.

 - What was the total tutoring time the Elenas dedicated to this course?
   - We can see the answer: *385*.

 - What was the total time that all Elenas attended tutoring for?
   - We can see the answer: *1725*.
     ![Elenas](./sheets-screenshots/35.png)

The ease with which we could
answer these questions
using pivot tables effectively
demonstrates how useful they are.

 - By using filters, we could ignore irrelevant information.
 - By changing the "Summarize by" option and selecting "Show totals",
   we did not have to highlight any cells at all.
 - By changing the "Sort by" option,
   we did not have to look at cells anywhere other than those furthest left, right, up, or down.

Some of the problems below are a little more complicated,
and they will further highlight the utility of pivot tables.




## Creating Your Own Custom Pivot Table From Scratch

 - Scroll to the top of the pivot table editor.
 - Click `Clear all`.
 - Select `View > Freeze > no rows`.
 - We will now experiment with selecting
   categories for rows, columns, and values.




## Just Rows and Values

 - Next to the heading saying **Rows**...
   - Click `Add`.
   - Click `Course`.
 - Next to the heading saying **Values** (not columns)...
   - Click `Add`.
   - Click `Time (Minutes)`.
 - We now have a table showing us
   how many tutoring minutes were spent on each course.
   ![Rows and Values](./sheets-screenshots/36.png)



## Grouping

 - Next to the heading saying **Rows** (again, not columns)...
   - Click `Add`.
   - Click `Timestamp`.
 - Now we see all the timestamps
   and they are organized by course.
   However, this presentation is somewhat overwhelming.
   - Right-click (or two-finger tap) on any of the timestamps.
   - Select `Create pivot date group > Day of the week`.
     ![Grouping](./sheets-screenshots/37.png)
 - We now have a table showing us
   how many tutoring minutes were
   spent on each course broken down
   by the day of the week.
 - In the pivot table editor,
   drag the gray box that says
   "Timestamp - Day of the week"
   to under the columns header.
 - Click on the image below. Wow!!
   <img id="wow" src="./sheets-screenshots/38.png" alt="Moving timestamp from rows to columns"/>
   <script>
     const wow = document.getElementById('wow');
     let wow_clicked_on_an_even_number_of_times = true;
     wow.addEventListener('click', function() {
       wow_clicked_on_an_even_number_of_times = !wow_clicked_on_an_even_number_of_times;
       wow.src = wow_clicked_on_an_even_number_of_times ? './sheets-screenshots/38.png' : './sheets-screenshots/39.png';
     });
   </script>




## Two Rows, a Column, and Values

 - Clear your previous pivot table.
   - Scroll to the top of the pivot table editor.
   - Click `Clear all`.
   - Select `View > Freeze > 2 rows`.
 - We will now reconstruct our first pivot table step-by-step.
   - Next to the heading saying **Rows**...
     - Click `Add`.
     - Click `Name`.
   - Next to the heading saying **Columns**...
     - Click `Add`.
     - Click `Course`.
   - Next to the heading saying **Values**...
     - Click `Add`.
     - Click `Time (Minutes)`.
 - Now we add some more row information.
   Next to the heading saying **Rows**...
   - Click `Add`.
   - Click `UID`.
 - On row 9 and 10, we can see that there are two students called Amina Lopez.
   ![Amina Lopez](./sheets-screenshots/40.png)
 - Let's account for students with the same name more elegantly.
   - In the pivot table editor,
     drag the gray box that says "UID"
     to be above the gray box that says "Name".
   - Deselect "Show totals" for "Name".
 - Now we have a table where students with the same name
   and different UIDs are acknowledged as different students,
   and the information is displayed nice and clearly.
   ![Useful UIDs](./sheets-screenshots/41.png)
   We see two students named Grace O'Connor on row 40 and row 63.




## Some Questions About The Data

Try to answer the following questions using pivot tables as effectively as possible.

 - How many students who attended tutoring are called Grace?
 - Which Grace attended the most tutoring sessions?
 - What was the total number of tutoring sessions they attended?
 - Which three students spent the most time at the tutoring sessions?
 - Which three students attended the most tutoring sessions greater than 90 minutes long?
 - Still need to add some of the other questions that Bon-Soon came up with.
