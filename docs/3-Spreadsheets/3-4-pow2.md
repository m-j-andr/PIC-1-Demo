# 2048 and friends




This exercise has two purposes.
 - It will emphasize the concept of datatypes.
 - It will show you that intimidating math problems can
   often be attacked by a computer without too much difficult.




## Powers of 2


You might have played the game [2048](https://play2048.co/){:target="_blank"} before.

![2048](./data/2048.png)

You can see that this game involves the numbers
<div>
  \[
    2,\ 4,\ 8,\ 16,\ 32,\ 64,\ 128,\ 256,\ 512.
  \]
</div>

These numbers are called *powers of two* because they
are equal to the following numbers, respectively.
<div>
  \[
    2^1,\ 2^2,\ 2^3,\ 2^4,\ 2^5,\ 2^6,\ 2^7,\ 2^8,\ 2^9
  \]
</div>

For a positive integer $n$,
we can calculate $2^n$ using the following rules.

 - $2^0 = 1$
 - $2^{k + 1} = 2\times 2^k$.

These rules tell us that we can calculate $2^n$ by
starting with $1$ and doubling it $n$ times.
<div>
  \[2048\ =\ 2^{11}\ =\ 2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2\]
</div>




## The leading digit of powers of two


Here is a question that sounds quite intimidating.

> Suppose someone
  picks a power of two ($2^n$ where $n\geq 1$) at random
  and writes down its first digit on a piece of paper.
  If you had to guess what digit they wrote down,
  is there a best option for your guess?

It is an intimidating question for a few reasons.

 - There is math, the most disliked of all the subjects!
 - The word "random".
 - Powers of two get really big, really fast. $2^{64}$ already has 20 digits.

However,
we have become acquainted with Google Sheets,
and so we can make some progress on this problem!

If we look at the nine powers of two
that we listed at the start,
then we can make the following table.

| Digit | Number of times it is the first digit of $2^n$ |
| ----: | :----------------------------------------------|
|   1   |                 2 (16 and 128)                 |
|   2   |                 2 (2 and 256)                  |
|   3   |                 1 (32)                         |
|   4   |                 1 (4)                          |
|   5   |                 1 (512)                        |
|   6   |                 1 (64)                         |
|   7   |                 0                              |
|   8   |                 1 (8)                          |
|   9   |                 0                              |

This does not reveal a pattern,
but we can hope that a pattern
appears when we use more data.
It would be tedious for us
to enter 999 powers of two by hand,
but we can make Google Sheets
calculate these numbers for us.




## Making a table that is appropriate for addressing the problem

 - Through your g.ucla.edu email,
   open [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets){:target="_blank"}.
   - Click on the icon with 9 dots at the top-right, next to UCLA.
   - Select `Sheets`.
 - Click on `Blank spreadsheet`.
 - Title your document as `Pow2`
   by replacing the text that says "Untitled spreadsheet".
 - Make the following column headings.
   - n
   - 2 to the n (as number)
   - 2 to the n (as text)
   - First digit (as text)
   - First digit (as number)
   - Experimental (a number)
 - We want the first column to contain the numbers 1 to 99.
   - Type 1 into `A2`.
   - Type 2 into `A3`.
   - Highlight `A2` and `A3`.
   - Hover your mouse where the blue circle is:
     at the bottom-right of the highlighted region.
     A cross (+) will appear.
   - Click and drag down all the way to the bottom, cell `A1000`.
   - BOOM!
 - We want to use a table as before.
   - Highlight from columns `A` to `F`.
   - Select `Format > Convert to table` from the top menu.
   - Click at the top of the table (dark green)
     where it says `Table1` and edit it to say `Powers_of_Two`.
   - Use the arrows in the column headings.
     - Select `2 to the n (as text) > Edit column type > Text`.
     - Select `First digit (as text) > Edit column type > Text`.
     - Select `n > Edit column type > Number > Number`.
     - Select `2 to the n (as number) > Edit column type > Number > Number`.
     - Select `First digit (as number) > Edit column type > Number > Number`.
     - Select `Experimental (a number) > Edit column type > Number > Number`.
   - Select columns `A` to `F` and then
     select `Format > Alignment > Center` from the top menu.
 - If your table looks like the following screenshot, well done!
   ![Empty Powers_of_two Table](./sheets-screenshots/49.png)




## Calculating $2^n$

We can perform this calculation in Google Sheets.
 - **Type `= POW(2, A2)` into cell `B2` and hit the `ENTER` key.**
 - Allow the "suggested autofill".

Scrolling down,
you can see that the numbers get very big.
Google Sheets will not know all the digits of these big numbers,
but it knows the first digit, which is what we care about.




## Picking off the first digit

One can think about picking off the first digit of a number in two distinct ways.
Suppose the number is 314159265, so that the first digit is 3.

 1. The first method to pick off the first digit involves math.
    <div>
      \[
        3\ =\ \left\lfloor     3.14159265                                          \right\rfloor\ 
           =\ \left\lfloor\frac{314159265}{100000000                              }\right\rfloor\ 
           =\ \left\lfloor\frac{314159265}{10^8                                   }\right\rfloor\ 
           =\ \left\lfloor\frac{314159265}{10^{\lfloor\log_{10}(314159265)\rfloor}}\right\rfloor
      \]
    </div>
    Therefore $\left\lfloor\frac{x}{10^{\lfloor\log_{10}(x)\rfloor}}\right\rfloor$ is
    a formula for the first significant digit of $x$.

    This can be written in Google Sheets by typing
    `= FLOOR(B2 / POW(10, FLOOR( LOG10(B2) ) ) )`.

    This is completely reasonable,
    but **we do not wish to assume that you know about logarithms or the floor function,**
    and if you do not know them, then this formula is probably quite displeasing to you.
    Moreover, the second method is going to feel much simpler.

 2. Forget about thinking of 314159265 as a number.
    Just think of it as a sequence of characters.
    What is the first character?
    Said another way,
    what is the character furthest to the left?
    It is the character 3, exactly what we are after!
    Moreover, there is a function in Google Sheets
    called `LEFT` that gives the left-most
    character in a chunk of text!

For some of our columns, we have specified *number* as the datatype.
For some of our columns, we have specified *text* as the datatype.
The first method is suited to the *number* datatype,
whereas the second method is suited to the *text* datatype.
Throughout this course, we will use *italics* to indicate
when "number" and "text" refer to the datatypes
rather than the ordinary use of these words.




## The datatype *text* and the datatype *number*

Before progressing any further,
it is useful to highlight some differences
between the two datatypes: *text* and *number*.
**Beware: some of this might feel uncomfortable for you because
you are about to see that computers are often far-from-perfect at math!**

 - In cell `C49`,
   type `Hello, cell!`.
   - The text you just typed is stored without a problem.

 - In cell `C51`,
   type `1125899906842624`
   (the value of $2^{50}$).
   - The text you just typed is stored without a problem.

 - In cell `F49`,
   type `Hello, cell!`.
   - A little red triangle appears at the top-right.
   - Upon hovering over it, you receive a message saying,
     "Invalid: This value does not match the column type **number**".
   - This is reasonable. `Hello, cell!` is not a number!

 - In cell `F51`,
   type `1125899906842624`
   (the value of $2^{50}$).
   - A little red triangle appears at the top-right.
   - Upon hovering over it, you receive a message saying,
     "Invalid: This value does not match the column type **number**".
   - This is confusing!
     Why can the datatype *number*
     not store the numical value 1125899906842624??
     We need to investigate!

 - In cell `F51`,
   type `1125899906842620` (the value of $2^{50} - 4$),
   or edit the last `4` of what you previously typed to be `0`.
   - This value is stored without a problem.
   - It is displayed as "1.1259E+15".
   - It is confusing that
     the previous numerical value led to problems
     and that this numerical value does not.
     We need to investigate more!
   - **ASIDE.** It turns out that the values stored by
     cell `B51` and cell `F51` as equal! Hmm.

 - In cell `F53`,
   type `0.12345678901234567890` and hit `ENTER`.
   - Click on the cell again.
   - You will see that it behaved
     as though you typed
     `0.123456789012345`,
     that is, it has ignored 
     the last five digits that you typed.
   - Hmm.

 - In cell `F55`,
   type `= 12345678901234567890` and hit `ENTER`.
   - Click on the cell again.
   - You will see that it behaved
     as though you typed
     `= 12345678901234500000`,
     that is, it has replaced 
     the last five digits that you typed by zeros.
   - Hmm.

 - Cells `F51`, `F53`, and `F55` all demonstrate that
   **Google Sheets will only let you specify
   a value for the datatype *number*
   to 15 significant figures.**
   In case you have forgotten about significant figures,
   here are a few examples.
   - The first significant digit of 0.0012345678 is 1.
   - Truncating 0.0012345678 to 3 significant figures gives 0.00123.
   - The first significant digit of 87654321 is 8.
   - Truncating 87654321 to 6 significant figures gives 87654300.

 - In cell `F57`,
   type `= POW(2, 63) - 9223372036854770000` and hit `ENTER`.
   - The calculation gives 6144.
   - The mathematically correct answer to $2^{63} - 9223372036854770000$ is $5808$.
   - **The *number* datatype is not able to perform this arithmetic correctly.**

 - You might be interested in how Google, C++, and Python perform on the last calculation.
   - In response to `2^63 - 9223372036854770000`, Google says 0.
   - In C++, `pow(2, 63) - 9223372036854770000` gives 6144.
   - Typing `2**63 - 9223372036854770000` into Python gives 5808 which is correct!
   - Python is great at integer arithmetic.
     However, later on, we will see that it says that
     the product of 20.15 and 100 is **not** equal to 2015.

### The datatype *text*

When a cell's datatype is *text*,
it can store up to 50,000 characters.

 - Characters from the English alphabet are allowed.
 - All the digits (0 to 9) are allowed.
 - Some special characters like spaces are allowed too.

We can use a function called `VALUE`
to attempt to obtain a *number*
from some *text*.
 - When the stored *text* is `123456.75`,
   using `VALUE` produces a *number* that stores 123456.75.
   - We will see plenty of successful uses of `VALUE` shortly.
 - When the stored *text* is `Hello, cell!`, using `VALUE` gives an error.
   - To see this, type `= VALUE(C49)` into cell `F49`.
 - When the stored *text* is `1125899906842624`, using `VALUE` gives an error
   because 1125899906842624 has more than 15 significant figures.
   - To see this, type `= VALUE(C51)` into cell `F51`.


<br>


### The datatype *number*

When a cell's datatype is *number*,
it can store many numerical values.
**There are limitations to which numbers can
be stored and which numbers can be entered.**
A computer cannot store the exact value of $\pi$,
and we have seen that there are values that
we are not allowed to enter:
some values produce errors,
and some values are changed
when we use them with `=`.
We can use *numbers* for arithmetic.
**The accuracy of arithmetic is not always perfect.**
In many applications, this lack of precision can be ignored,
but this issue can matter more than you might expect.

Any *number* can be used to produce some *text*
by using the `TO_TEXT` function. We will see
plenty of uses of `TO_TEXT` shortly.




## Addressing the $2^n$ problem

 - Delete the content of cells
   `C49`, `C51`, 
   `F49`, `F51`, `F53`, `F55`, and `F57`. 
 - Type `= TO_TEXT(B2)` into cell `C2` and hit the `ENTER` key.
 - Allow the "suggested autofill".
 - **NOTE.** Typing `= B2` instead of `= TO_TEXT(B2)`
   would have created an error: "Invalid: This value
   does not match the column type **text**".
 - Type `= LEFT(C2)` into cell `D2` and hit the `ENTER` key.
 - Allow the "suggested autofill".
 - Type `= VALUE(D2)` into cell `E2` and hit the `ENTER` key.
 - Allow the "suggested autofill".
 - **NOTE.** Typing `= D2` instead of `= VALUE(D2)`
   would have created an error: "Invalid: This value
   does not match the column type **number**".
 - Make a pivot table.
