# Further food for thought

- What if we use a different model?

  Because of how well our quadratic model already fits the data
  **and** the imprecision of our data (blurry data points),
  it is difficult for us to claim that any
  other model will fit our data better.

- How do we assess which model is correct?

  When discussing science, rather than saying "the model (or theory) that fits
  the data most closely out of the models (and theories) currently available"
  people frequently say "correct model (or theory)" instead.
  They are often wrong to say this because in most scenarios,
  it is possible for new models (or theories) to appear
  that fit the data of the world even more precisely.

  For example,
  [Newton's theory of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation){:target="_blank"}
  seemed pretty wonderful until [Einstein's theory of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity){:target="_blank"}
  was discovered.
  [GPS on planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System#Relativistic_corrections){:target="_blank"}
  use Einstein's theory of relativity to do their job and Newton's theory does not suffice.

  - Is Einstein's theory correct?
    It is the best theory of gravity currently available to us and
    it is good for understanding the universe in regions of both large scale and high mass.

  - Is quantum mechanics correct?
    It is the best theory currently available to us
    for understanding the universe in regions of both very small scale and low mass.

  - However, it is a longstanding Physics problem to come up with
    [a theory that unites these two theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything){:target="_blank"}.
    Perhaps, such a theory will eventually appear, and perhaps it will perform an even better job than
    general relativity and quantum mechanics at predicting patterns in the observable world.

- Can one provide an explanation for why a particular model works well?
  For example, why does the quadratic model work so well?

  Sometimes an existing scientific theory explains patterns in data.
  Sometimes new explanations need to be considered.
  For the motion of a thrown ball,
  the quadratic equation can be derived from Newton's laws of gravity.
  However, this model only acknowledges gravity and it ignores air resistance.
  I doubt [Rafa Nadal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal_at_the_French_Open){:target="_blank"}'s
  topspin forehands at Roland Garros ever followed a quadratic equation,
  and his record at Roland Garros certainly defies explanation.

Can you think of a good name for this collection of questions?
**Science!!**

Science is all about generating models to describe the world,
assessing how well they work, why they work,
whether there is an underlying theory that explains their effectiveness,
in what contexts they work well or do not work well,
and coming up with ways to improve their accuracy.
