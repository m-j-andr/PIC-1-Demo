# Further food for thought

- What if we use a different model?

  Because of how well our quadratic model already fits the data
  **and** the imprecision of our data (blurry data points),
  it is difficult for us to claim that
  another model fits our data better.

- How do we assess which model is correct?

  When discussing science, rather than saying "the model that
  fits the data best out of the models currently available"
  people frequently say "correct model" instead.
  They are often incorrect to say this because in most scenarios,
  there is the possibility for a new model to appear later that
  fits the data of the world even more precisely.

  For example,
  [Newton's theory of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation){:target="_blank"}
  seemed pretty wonderful until [Einstein's theory of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity){:target="_blank"}
  was discovered.
  [GPS on planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System#Relativistic_corrections){:target="_blank"}
  use Einstein's theory of relativity in order to do their job.

  - Is Einstein's theory correct?
    It is the best theory of gravity currently available to us and
    it is good for understanding the universe in regions of both large scale and high mass.

  - Is quantum mechanics correct?
    It is the best theory currently available to us
    for understanding the universe in regions of both very small scale and low mass.

  - However, it is a longstanding Physics problem to come up with
    [a theory that unites these two theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything){:target="_blank"}.
    Perhaps, such a theory will eventually exist, and perhaps it will do a better job than
    general relativity and quantum mechanics in observable ways.

- Can one provide an explanation for why a particular model works well?
  For example, why does the quadratic model work so well?

  Sometimes an existing scientific theory will explain patterns in data.
  Sometimes new explanations need to be considered.
  For the motion of a thrown ball,
  the quadratic equation can be derived using Newton's laws of gravity.
  However, this model ignores air resistance.
  I doubt [Rafa Nadal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal_at_the_French_Open){:target="_blank"}'s
  topspin forehands at Roland Garros ever followed a quadratic equation.

Can you think of a good name for this collection of questions?
Science!!
