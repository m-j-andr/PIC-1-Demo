# Orbit of Saturn

A cartoon depiction of the orbits of the planets in our solar system is drawn below.

 - Using this cartoon, estimate the ratio of
   the radius of Saturn's orbit to the radius of Earth's orbit.
   The real orbits are elliptical,
   but you can assume they are circular
   (like the pizzas in [example 2](2-2.md)).

 - In the cartoon, is the Sun at the center of Earth's orbit?

 - In the cartoon, is the Sun at the center of Saturn's orbit?

 - Calculate another interesting ratio...
   - Start with the $y$-coordinate Desmos learned for the center of Saturn's orbit.
   - Subtract the $y$-coordinate Desmos learned for the center of Earth's orbit.
   - Divide the difference by the value Desmos learned for the radius of Earth's orbit.

 - Look up "the radius of the orbit of saturn in astrological units, perihelion, aphelion".
   In what ways is the cartoon depiction close-to-accurate
   with regards to the orbits of Saturn and Earth,
   and it what ways is it inaccurate?
