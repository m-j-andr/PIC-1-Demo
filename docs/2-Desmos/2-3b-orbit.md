# Orbit of Saturn

A cartoon depiction of the orbits of the planets in our solar system is drawn to scale below.

 - Estimate the ratio of the radius of Saturn's orbit to the radius of Earth's orbit.
   These orbits are elliptical, but you can assume they are circular
   (like the pizzas in [example 2](2-2.md)).

 - Look up the radius of the orbit of Saturn and Earth, so that you can calculate
   the true ratio of the radius of Saturn's orbit to the radius of Earth's orbit.
   How accurate is the cartoon depiction with regards to the orbits of Saturn and Earth?
