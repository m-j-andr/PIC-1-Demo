# An Amazing Maze of Paths




## Setup

 - Download [maze.zip](./maze.zip) and unzip it to obtain a folder called `maze`.

 - Four text files with extension `.txt` are contained within `maze`'s subfolders.

 - Three of the four files are named after gemstones.




## Your tasks

 1. Find each of the four text files. Write down their relative file path starting from the `maze` folder.

    For example, you could look inside the folder with relative path `./e/8/5/k/1` to see that
    there is no file with the relative path `./e/8/5/k/1/gemstone.txt`.

 2. **After opening and reading the text files...** What is the secret word?
