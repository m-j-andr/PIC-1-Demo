After successfully creating the folder structure
explained [here](1-2-folders.md) and indicated above,
create a ZIP archive using the PIC-1 folder.
Submit `PIC-1.zip` to Gradescope.


### Zipping files on MacOS

Right-click (or two-finger tap) on the folder `PIC-1`,
and select "Compress PIC-1".

### Zipping files on Windows

[7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html){:target="_blank"} is
the best tool for creating ZIP archives on Windows.

Right-click on the folder `PIC-1`,
click on "Show more options" (if necessary),
and select "7-Zip > Add to "PIC-1.zip"".

### Extra files and/or folders

If you already progressed further before completing this homework assignment
and you have more files and/or folders than indicated above, do not worry:
it is okay to submit them; just make sure that you are *not missing* any files or folders.




## HW-1

 - Create a folder called `HW-1` within `0-Homework-Assignments`.
 - Use Sublime Text to save a file called `solutions.txt` within `HW-1`,
   that is, within the folder whose path is

   - "File > Save" is one option.
   - "Command + S" on MacOS or "ctrl + S" on Windows provide other options.
   - Sublime Text does **not** autosave.
   - A circle on a tab, next to a filename,
     indicates that you have unsaved changes.
